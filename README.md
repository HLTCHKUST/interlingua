# High-Dimensional Interlingual Representations of Large Language Models

Large language models (LLMs) trained on multilingual data may form shared interlingual representations, but evidence is mixed. We analyze 31 languages across resource levels, typologies, and regions, finding inconsistent cross-lingual alignments. To address this, we propose an interlingual representation framework that identifies both shared and fragmented components. We introduce the Interlingual Local Overlap (ILO) score to quantify alignment by comparing local neighborhood structures. <br>
